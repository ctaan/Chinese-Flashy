# Chinese-Flashy

Hi there! This is my work in progress chinese flash card game.

I have built a simple flash card game using python that you can use to practice simple chinese words. The chinese words have been taken from Wikipedia - https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Mandarin_Frequency_lists/1-1000, of which 279 characters have been selected to be a part of this app. You can view the characters in the csv file located in the data folder.

This is a very simple game and is a MVP. I have built this using pycharm.  

There are two sides of the card - the chinese character and the pinyin/translation. This is timed to give you 4 seconds to read the character before giving you the answer. During this time you will be able to select either the 'tick' or 'cross', 'tick' being you know the word and 'cross' being the alternative. In the case where a cross is selected, this will be added to a csv file called 'words-to-learn', where you will be able to view all the words that you selected cross to. 

Improvements to be made to the app:
*Start button to commence game
*Resizable window frame with automatic content resizing
*Improved UX/UI - button display, card canvas
*Translation accuracy of chinese character list
*words-to-learn csv file readability in desktop folder (currently readable only in python editor)
*Select the number of characters you want to learn ie. 50 or 100
*Availability of different languages 
*Display results ie. 5/50 or characters not known
*List to be continued as I test and get feedback...

**note: **Further functionality and improvements to design are currently in progress. Please see 'improvements' list.
